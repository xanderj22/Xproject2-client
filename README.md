Initial wire frame sketches are located here: 

A full-stack application created using HTMl, CSS, Javascript, jquery AJAX, Express API, Mongoose? and json.

My process involved referencing WDI course materials, reviewing online resources such as w3schools.com, reviewing the full-stack project issue queue, collaborating with other developers in training, and getting help from the amazing WDI instructors.

My greatest struggles centered around storing and retrieving data, and figuring out how all of the front-end and back-end files were interacting.

User stories:

-A user should be able to sign-up/create account with email and password.
-A user should be able to sign-in with that account each time.
-A user should be able to enter and store user profile data
-A user should be able to update/change current profile data
-A user should be able to show/display current user profile
-A user should be able to delete account and user profile data.
-A user should be able to change password.
-A user should be able to sign-out.


Future versions and improvements might include:

Better user experience:
  -more user friendly layout
  -buttons that open forms to enter user data
  -better display of user data
  -keyword search capability
  -user interaction -- the ability to see other user profile data
